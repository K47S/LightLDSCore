# LightLDS
This is a lightweight implementation of the OPC UA Local Discovery Server.

The OPC Foundation has its own reference implementation based on the ANSI C stack which is released an maintained by them.

We had some stability issues with the sample inplementation so I decided to take my own approach and inplement the server with the .Net Standard stack.

Please note that this implementation is only for demo purposes and test scenarios. It does not implement the whole certificate security stuff. If you need that please fork this repo or send a pull request.
